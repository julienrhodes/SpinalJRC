Design Errors/Warnings
----------------------

WARNING - map: The JTAG port has been disabled in this project and JTAG pins
     will be configured as General Purpose IO.  You have to use JTAGENB pin in
     hardware to change the personality of the port from JTAG pins to general
     purpose IO.  Reference MachXO2 Handbook for details on dual function JTAG
     port.
WARNING - map: All configuration ports of the design have been disabled.

GSR Usage (cont)
----------------
   The Global Set Reset (GSR) resource has been used to implement a global reset
        of the design. The reset signal used for GSR control is 'reset_c'.
        

     GSR Property:
   The design components with GSR property set to ENABLED will respond to global
        set reset while the components with GSR property set to DISABLED will
        not.
        

     Components with disabled GSR Property
-------------------------------------

     These components have the GSR property set to DISABLED. The components will
     not respond to the reset signal 'reset_c' via the GSR component.
